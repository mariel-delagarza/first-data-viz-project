# Background
This is my first data visualization project - as part of my internship at CSIS, I will be working heavily with datasets and a JavaScript library called [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/).

To get familiar with Highcharts, my task was to find a dataset I thought interesting and use Highcharts to create a chart with it. 

I chose to use the Johns Hopkins dataset re: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The set is available via many repositories; the version I chose to work with was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report). 

## Initial Drafts
On Friday, 3/6/20, I created the first version of these charts based on the "confirmed" column in the original dataset. The chart with all countries was too crowded, so I divided them into groups based on the United Nations working groups, with additions as needed (e.g. Taiwan is placed in the Asia-Pacific Group and Saint Barthelemy is in the Latin-Amerca and the Carribbean group).
